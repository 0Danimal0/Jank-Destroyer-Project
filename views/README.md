Welcome to my Pizza Project!

To run this application, open the index.html file in a web browser.

The optimizations I made were to remove all forced synchronous layout 'jank' performance
hiccups from the processing of this document. This means to make sure to group up and
all around limit the amount of times the Layout functioning of the browser occurs.
I also reduced the amount of painting that occured on the page by implementing a
'transform: translateX____' CSS command.

Thanks for checking it out!
